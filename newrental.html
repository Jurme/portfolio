            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                   
                <p> In the realm of real estate, there exists a pressing need for a comprehensive 
                    solution that seamlessly integrates property rental management and a user-friendly rental 
                    marketplace. The absence of such a system creates challenges for individuals seeking a 
                    streamlined approach to finding suitable homes for rent, as well as for property owners in 
                    efficiently onboarding tenants and managing their properties. Traditional methods of renting 
                    properties and managing tenants are fraught with manual processes, inefficiencies, and 
                    fragmented tools, leading to time-consuming tasks, potential errors, and frustrated 
                    stakeholders. Consequently, there is a clear demand for a solution that automates 
                    the rental process, facilitates seamless property onboarding, and empowers property
                    owners to effortlessly manage tenants.

                <h3>Qualitative Research - User Interviews </h3>
                <p> To recruit interview participants, I conducted a screening survey to represent a diverse demographic
                     and user group of property owners and tenants or people looking for the next home. 
                     This helped to conduct two sets of interviews with property owners and tenants or people
                     who want to find new homes. We conducted phone interviews 
                     with 6 property owners and 7 tenants to gain insights into the difficulties they encounter
                     when it comes to listing properties for rent and the processes involved in o
                     nboarding and overseeing tenants.
